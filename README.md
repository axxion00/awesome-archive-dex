Awesome Archive of Assets on Decentralised Exchanges

## AMM Approach 
- Modern DEXs run on automated market maker protocols, doing away with order books and providing liquidity via pools of trading pairs. 
- Anyone is able to contribute their assets to these liquidity pools; 
- These liquidity providers are incentivized to do so 
- It is done by sharing portions of the fees and commissions generated by every swap made in the pool.
